1. s : Sugi forest
2. h : Hinoki forest
3. d : Mixed deciduous forest
4. o : Other non-forest land

### TL;DR

* Explore the dataset
* Perform feature engineering
* Train a Decision Tree Classifier using cross-validation
* Train an SVM Classifier using cross-validation
* Compare the accuracy scores of the two models
* Comment on Accuracy vs. Interpretability
