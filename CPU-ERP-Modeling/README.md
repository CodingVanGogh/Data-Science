---
## Problem Statment
Given a dataset about various features of a CPU such as, model, vendor, Published Relative performance etc., build a model to  Estimate the Relative performance of a CPU.

## TL;DR
* Explore the data
* Perform feature engineering
* Build two models; Ridge Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor
* Compare the performance of the two models and pick the best one
